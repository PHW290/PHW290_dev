Welcome to Lab 3 !!!

Great article from [Harvard Business Review about data visualization that really work](https://hbr.org/2016/06/visualizations-that-really-work).

The [R Graph Gallery](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/index.html) is an excellent resource for data visualization ideas AND code to accomplish these visualizations.

[A nice website detailing many of the tools we've learned already for creating nice tables](https://rfortherestofus.com/2019/11/how-to-make-beautiful-tables-in-r/).

[Our World in Data has some great visualizations](https://ourworldindata.org/).

If you're working on your Desktop and want to change up your RStudio Theme, [check out these themes made by the community](https://tmtheme-editor.herokuapp.com/#!/editor/theme/Monokai).

```{r, out.width="50%", fig.align="center", echo=F}

Today's goals:

Part 0: 

What questions do you have? 

Part 1:

* rotating graphs
* modifying axis limits
* ordering by value 
* creating text labels 
* adding annotations
* saving plots

Part 2:

* scaling axis (values/time)
* hiding x and y elements

Part 3:

* using functions to "automate" graph creation
* detailed modifying of graph elements

\newpage 

```{r, include=F, echo=F}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(ggthemes)
```

### Part 1

* rotating graphs
* modifying axis limits
* ordering by value 
* creating text labels 
* adding annotations

The [ggthemes packages has some nice options](https://yutannihilation.github.io/allYourFigureAreBelongToUs/ggthemes/).

```{r}
gen_plot <- read_csv("data/sample_plot.csv")


```

\newpage

### Part 2:

* scaling axis (values/time)
* hiding x and y elements

For the remainder of the lab, we will use data from the [UC Berkeley Safe Campus study](https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/covid-19/safe-campus-initiative/charts-and-graphs/) that took place from June to August 2020. The goal of the study was to inform the campus of the safest possible way to re-open campus, if at all. 

```{r}
df_covid <- read_csv("data/daily_symptoms.csv") %>% mutate(ts_daily = mdy(ts_daily))


```

Part 3:

* using functions to "automate" graph creation
* detailed modifying of graph element

Wow! That took a lot of time and lines of code, and it was for only one graph! We have 8 more symptoms to go. Let's make a function.

There's a slight variation in the syntax for dyplr when using it within a custom function.

```{r}
symptoms_covid <- function ( data, var ) {
  # create string of variable to later to create column marker
  var.name <- gsub( "_", " ", as.character(substitute( var ) ))
  data %>%
    mutate( var = ifelse( {{ var }} < 0, NA, {{ var }} )) %>%
    # filter out NAs to remove from denominator
    filter( !is.na( var ) ) %>%
    # pair down to variables of interest
    select( ts_daily, var ) %>%
    # group by time
    group_by( ts_daily ) %>%
    summarize( num = sum( var ),         # numerator
               total = n(),              # get total
               prop = num / total ) %>%  # calculate
    # add variable column marker
    mutate(var.name = var.name)
}
```

We can now create the same graph quite quickly for a different symptom:

```{r}
symptoms_covid(df_covid, Cough) %>%
  ggplot( aes(x = ts_daily, y = prop) ) +
    # creating bars
    geom_col() +
    # change x axis to show month/day, separated by 14 days
    scale_x_date( date_labels = "%b/%d", date_breaks = "14 day" ) +
    # change y axis into percent and limit between 0, 0.03
    scale_y_continuous( limits = c(0, 0.03), labels = scales::percent ) +
    # remove x and y titles, and add overall title
    labs(x = element_blank(),
         y = element_blank(),
         title = "Students: Cough") +
    # take advantage of available themes!
    theme_fivethirtyeight()

```

\newpage

```{r, echo=F}
temp_a <- symptoms_covid(df_covid, Blocked_runny_nose)
temp_b <- symptoms_covid(df_covid, Cough)
temp_c <- symptoms_covid(df_covid, Fatigue)
temp_d <- symptoms_covid(df_covid, Feverish)
temp_e <- symptoms_covid(df_covid, Gastrointestinal_symptoms)
temp_f <- symptoms_covid(df_covid, Loss_of_sense_of_taste_or_smell)
temp_g <- symptoms_covid(df_covid, Muscle_pain_or_body_aches)
temp_h <- symptoms_covid(df_covid, Respiratory_symptoms)
temp_i <- symptoms_covid(df_covid, Sore_throat)

symp_plot <- dplyr::bind_rows( temp_a, temp_b, temp_c, temp_d, temp_e,
                               temp_f, temp_g, temp_h, temp_i )
```

Final product:

```{r}
ggplot(symp_plot, aes(x = ts_daily, y = prop, fill = var.name)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_wrap(~ var.name) +
  scale_x_date(date_labels = "%b/%d", date_breaks = "14 day") +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 0.03), labels = scales::percent) +
  labs(x = element_blank(), 
       y = element_blank(), 
       title = "Daily student reported symptoms",
       subtitle = "by type of symptom",
       caption = "for entire duration of the study",
       color = element_blank()) +
  theme_fivethirtyeight() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(color = "#003262"),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(color = "#FDB515"),
        panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
        plot.background = element_rect(fill = "white", colour = "white"),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white", color = "white"),
        strip.background = element_rect(colour = "white", fill = "white"),
        legend.position = "none",
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle= 45, hjust = 1),
        axis.text.y = element_text()) +
  guides(colour = guide_legend(nrow = 3)) 
```
