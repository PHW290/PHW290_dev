* Due date: !
* Submission process: Please submit your assignment directly to Gradescope. You can do this by knitting your file and downloading the PDF to your computer. Then navigate to Gradescope.com or via the link on BCourses to submit your assignment. 

Helpful hints:

- Knit your file early and often to minimize knitting errors! If you copy and paste code from the slides, you are bound to get an error that is hard to diagnose. Typing out the code is the way to smooth knitting. We recommend knitting your file each time after you write a few sentences/add a new code chunk, so yu can detect the source of the knitting error more easily. This will save you and the teaching team time!

- Please make sure that your code does not run off the page of the knitted PDF. If it does, we can't see your work. To avoid this, have a look at your knitted PDF and ensure all the code fits in the file. When it doesn't, go back to your .Rmd file and add spaces (new lines) using hte return or enter key so that the code runs onto the next line.

### Question 

Create a data frame and a tibble that matches the image below:

```{r}
# by the way, you can load images into rmarkdown! Cool, right?!
library(knitr)
knitr::include_graphics('./table_replicate.png')
```

Hint: You may need to load the tidyverse library for tibbles!
```{r}
df <- data.frame(
  id = 101:105,
  gender = c("female", "male", "non-binary", "male", NA),
  temperature = c(98, 97.3, 101.1, 97.5, 99.6))
  
tib <- tibble(
  id = 101:105,
  gender = c("female", "male", "non-binary", "male", NA),
  temperature = c(98, 97.3, 101.1, 97.5, 99.6))
```

What are the key differences between data frames and tibbles? 

Why are tibbles preferable?
