* Due date: !
* Submission process: Please submit your assignment directly to Gradescope. You can do this by knitting your file and downloading the PDF to your computer. Then navigate to Gradescope.com or via the link on BCourses to submit your assignment. 

Helpful hints:

- Knit your file early and often to minimize knitting errors! If you copy and paste code from the slides, you are bound to get an error that is hard to diagnose. Typing out the code is the way to smooth knitting. We recommend knitting your file each time after you write a few sentences/add a new code chunk, so yu can detect the source of the knitting error more easily. This will save you and the teaching team time!

- Please make sure that your code does not run off the page of the knitted PDF. If it does, we can't see your work. To avoid this, have a look at your knitted PDF and ensure all the code fits in the file. When it doesn't, go back to your .Rmd file and add spaces (new lines) using hte return or enter key so that the code runs onto the next line.

### Question 

Create a data frame and a tibble that matches the image below:

```{r}
# by the way, you can load images into rmarkdown! Cool, right?!
# here we use the knitr library (though there are multiple ways to load images)
library(knitr)

# notice that we specify the path to look within the current directory
# by using the period: .
# followed by a slash: / to pull the image file
knitr::include_graphics('./table_replicate.png')
```

Hint: You may need to load the tidyverse library for tibbles!
```{r}
df <- data.frame(
  id = 101:105,
  gender = c("female", "male", "non-binary", "male", NA),
  temperature = c(98, 97.3, 101.1, 97.5, 99.6))
  
tib <- tibble(
  id = 101:105,
  gender = c("female", "male", "non-binary", "male", NA),
  temperature = c(98, 97.3, 101.1, 97.5, 99.6))
```

What are the key differences between data frames and tibbles? 

Why are tibbles preferable?

### Question

We just found out results for COVID testing and want to add it to our data. Using the tibble you just created, add the following test results to a new column called "results".

- 101 = NEGATIVE
- 102 = POSITIVE
- 103 = NEGATIVE
- 104 = NEGATIVE
- 105 = NEGATIVE

```{r}
tib$results <- c("NEGATIVE", "POSITIVE", "NEGATIVE", "NEGATIVE", "NEGATIVE")
```

### Question

Load the "stds-by-disease-county-year-sex.csv" data set. 

You can find more information about this data set from the California Open Data Portal:

https://data.ca.gov/dataset/stds-in-california-by-disease-county-year-and-sex

```{r}
library(readr)
stds <- read_csv("stds-by-disease-county-year-sex.csv",
                 skip = 3)
```
You may have noticed that there are empty cells in the first three rows. Modify your code above (if you haven't already) to remove these rows.

### Question

Let's explore this data set. Insert R chunks as needed. Find the following values:

```{r}
str(stds)
```

How many rows?
9558

How many columns? 
6

What are the column names?
Disease, County, Year, Sex, Cases, Population

What are the column types?
chr, chr, num, chr, num, num
